# Moji

Moji is a flexible React grid system for creating responsive layouts. Features customizable grids, debug mode, and accessibility support. Currently in beta.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the [Vercel Geist UI Grid component](https://vercel.com/geist/grid). While Geist UI is not open-source, I needed a similar tool for some internal stuff. Moji is my attempt to create an accessible, powerful grid system that meets my specific needs. Although it's currently a personal project, I've decided to open-source it in case it might be useful to other developers in the future.

## Current Status

Moji is currently in early development and is primarily maintained for personal use. While it's open-source, it may not yet be ready for production use in other projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome, but please note that active development and support may be limited.
